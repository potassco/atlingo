# Benchmarks

For the benchmarking we use the benchmarking tool as a submodule installed. We provide a set of useful commands and scripts. 

The files found in [./benchmarks/programs](../benchmarks/programs) correspond to our particular approach and are copied to the submodule folder to be used by the tool. A especial treatment of the scripts was needed to account for the preprocessing of each instance.

We use the following scripts to automatize the jobs for the benchmarks.


##### [./run_bm.sh](./run_bm.sh) 
- Generates specialized run scripts by duplicating the provided [template for the domain](./runscripts/runscript_asprilo-abc.xml) and replacing special parameters: (Horizon, number of models, and additional).
- Calls `./bgen` to generate benchmarking scripts from the benchmarking tool.
- Runs the start files for each instance. 
  By default, these files will make a call to slurm for adding a process to the queue with `sbatch`. If you wish to use python change variable `mode` to  `1`.
- Checks output for errors.
- Calls `./beval` to scrap the stats to a xml file
- Checks output for errors, if an error was found then shows the output with the internal error.
- Cleans output
- All results are saved in [./results](./results) inside the folder corresponding to the environment

##### [./batch_all_$DOM.sh](./batch_all.sh) 
- Cleans environment.
- Makes a series of calls to `./run_bm.sh` with different parameters.
- Gathers result summary
- Sends email to notify that evaluation finished.

##### [./compute_all_ods.sh](./compute_all_ods.sh) 
- Computes all the `.ods` files from the results


## Plots

A python plot script was created matching the patterns from our personalized benchmarks. 
This script takes the precalculated `.ods` results and generates images, tables and tikz files.

## *asprilo* Benchmarks from paper

1. Setup path to atlingo in folder in [./run_bm.sh](./run_bm.sh) and the desired mode

1. Run all benchmarks from script `./batch_all_asprilo-abc.sh`

2. Compute ods files `./compute_all_ods.sh`

3. Plot results `./plot_script_asprilo-abc.sh`


The benchmarks can run in a linux OS, if you are using a different system you would need to compile a runsolver and replace [./programs/runsolver-3.4](./programs/runsolver-3.4).
